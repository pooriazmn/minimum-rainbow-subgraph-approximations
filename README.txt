First, the file Graph.py contains our implementation of a graph. We use both adjacency lists and an edge list to store the graph. Each vertex contains a list of all of its neighbours and a list of all the edges it is incident to (since there may be multiple edges). Each edge points to the two vertices it is incident to and stores its colour. The graph class also stores the set of colours used in the graph (which is used in algorithm implementations) and a dictionary that associates with each possible degree the list of vertices with that degree (which is used in the rewire routine). This file also contains the rewire and random graph routines that are used to generate our data sets.

Next, the file Koch2011.py contains our implementation of the Greedy algorithm, the file schiermeyer2013.py contains our implementation of the colour matching algorithm, and the file tirodkar.py contains our implementation of Tirodkar's algorithm. The colour matching algorithm uses as a subroutine a maximum matching algorithm, the implementation of which can be found in the file max_matching.py.

Lastly, the file Tests.py contains functions to generate and run tests, as well as to process the results into the format we use to generate the graphs in the report. This was the main file that we ran to generate our results. Currently, this is set up so that data sets for graphs of size 10 will be produced, the tests will be run, and the output will be processed. All files and directories produced will now be preceded with the string "EXAMPLE_" to ensure that none of the data we used for the report will be overwritten. To use any other graph sizes, run the program with a list of graph sizes as command line arguments. For example, the command "python3 Tests.py 10 50 100" will generate data sets for graphs of size 10, 50, and 100, run all tests, and process the output.

The data sets can be found in the Tests directory. Each data set consists of (at most) 12 records and at least 2 records, separated with the '#' symbol. The first record is exactly the size, edge density, and number of colours used for the graphs in the data set. Each subsequent record is a graph in the data set. Each line of these records is an edge, represented with the first vertex it is incident to, the second, and the colour.

The raw test results can be found in the results-koch, results-schiermeyer, and results-tirodkar csv files. Each line of these files corresponds to a data set. The first entry is the algorithm used for the test, the second the size of the graphs, the third the edge density of the graphs, and the third the number of colours used for the graphs. All remaining entries are the number of vertices in the rainbow subgraph that the algorithm produced for a graph in the associated data set.

The processed test results can be found the the results-analysis-colours, results-analysis-density, and results-analysis-size csv files. These files are associated with the number of colours, density, and size of the graphs, respectively. Each line of these files is first the name of the algorithm that this data came from, then the value of the parameter in question, followed by the average performance of the algorithm on all data sets with the parameter set to that value. These are exactly the results that we used to produce the charts in the report.
